**Secure Shell (SSH) Keys**

### 1. Understanding SSH Keys

*   **What is an SSH Key?**
    *   Description: An SSH key is a pair of codes that secures your connection to a remote system.
    *   Components:
        *   **Private Key:** A secret password that only you know. Keep it safe and never share it with anyone.
        *   **Public Key:** A public ID that you can share with others. It helps the remote system recognize you and lets you in.

### 2. Generating an SSH Key

*   **Generating an SSH Key:**
    *   Command: `ssh-keygen`
    *   Description: Creates a new SSH key pair.
    *   Example: `ssh-keygen` (generates a new SSH key pair)
*   **Generated Files:**
    *   `id_rsa`: The private key. Keep it safe and don't share it with anyone.
    *   `id_rsa.pub`: The public key. Use this file to connect to the remote system.
