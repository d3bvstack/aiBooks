**What is an SSH Key?**

An SSH key is a special pair of codes that helps keep your connection to a remote system secure. This pair consists of two parts:

* A **private key**: This is like a secret password that only you know. You should keep it safe and never share it with anyone.
* A **public key**: This is like a public ID that you can share with others. It helps the remote system recognize you and lets you in.

**How to Generate an SSH Key**

To create an SSH key, `ssh-keygen`

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Two files generated:

* `id_rsa`: This is your private key. Keep it safe and don't share it with anyone.
* `id_rsa.pub`: This is your public key. You'll use this file to connect to the remote system.
