**Git**: A version control system that tracks changes in your codebase.
**Commits**: Snapshots of your codebase at a particular point in time.
**Commit IDs**: Unique identifiers for each commit, represented as a hash value.
**Shell Scripting**: A way to automate tasks by writing a series of commands in a file.

**Commands:**

`git log`: Displays a log of all commits made to the repository.
`git log --format`: Customizes the format of the log output.
`git log --format=%H`: Displays only the commit IDs (hash values).

**Shell Scripting Concepts:**

- Piping: Redirect output from one command to another.

Use `git log` to retrieve the commit history.
Use `--format=%H` to customize the output to display only commit IDs.
Use -5 to limit the output to the last 5 commits.
Use `bash` to execute the script and `cat -e` to display the output with line endings.
